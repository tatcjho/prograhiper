    <blockquote>
        <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendir has been steadily
        improving over the las 10 years with fine offerings from 
        Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
        Sajja Adulet is ti be congratulated for offering delicius
        and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
        Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off 
        the streets of Charlotte.

    <blockquote>
        <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street
        fare and we akk accceot its limitations in exchange for the 
        convenience ofa quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
        dont't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
        master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
        Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the 
        Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
